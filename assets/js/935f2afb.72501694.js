To solve this, Mesmer allows the definition of fine-grained rules on how metrics associated with different actors can be grouped together.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"supported-libraries/akka/supported-metrics":{"id":"supported-libraries/akka/supported-metrics","title":"Supported metrics","description":"Akka core","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"supported-libraries/zio/supported-metrics":{"id":"supported-libraries/zio/supported-metrics","title":"Supported metrics","description":"ZIO Metrics API","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"supported-libraries/zio/zio-example":{"id":"supported-libraries/zio/zio-example","title":"Example","description":"ZIO exposes a lot of information about its own and application internals out-of-the-box - like ZIO Executor metrics and JVM metrics.
